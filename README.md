<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Stack][stack-screenshot]]

Stack is nothing but a pseudo-project.

Usually, most of the projects are created to solve (or at least try to) a business problem. We choose the technology stack based on the solution approach.

Stack is the very opposite. First, I've defined a list of interesting/trending technologies and then I try to integrate them all. Hence the pseudo prefix.
 
The main purpose of this weird project is to find out the problems each technology is meant to solve firstly, and then dig into its functionalities.
But as you may have noticed, I'm one of those who think there is no better way to learn something than getting dirty, therefore the last step of integrating the learned tool into our little Frankstein. Cool, isn't it?
